// SHOULD be allowed to issue this request. The operation has one of two effects. If the revocation reason is “key compromise” or “CA compromise”,
// then the object is placed into the “compromised” state; the Date is set to the current date and time; and the Compromise Occurrence Date is
// set to the value (if provided) in the Revoke request and if a value is not provided in the Revoke request then Compromise Occurrence Date SHOULD
// be set to the Initial Date for the object. If the revocation reason is neither “key compromise” nor “CA compromise”,
// the object is placed into the “deactivated” state, and the Deactivation Date is set to the current date and time.
